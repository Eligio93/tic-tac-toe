# Tic tac toe game

## Description of the Project
FOr this project I had to implement the tic tac toe game, allowing two players to insert their name and choose their marker. The main goal of this project was to create the game using as little as possible global variable so focusing more on modules,IIFE and factory functions. It's "The Odin Project" course project

## Struggles Points

Biggest struggle was at the very beginning trying to understand where all the pieces of logic should have resided to build the game. How can i implement the display controller? and the game controller? How can i change the playing turn of each player? These were some of the questions came up in my mind at the very beginning.

Once the logic was fairly clear i had some trouble in declaring variable and keep in mind what was the scope of those and how to access them.

I didn't find easy also the part where I had to display all the informations collected on the DOM, when elements have to appear and disappear and i think the javascript part related to the dom was a bit repetitive.

Last but not least, understand how to implement the function that check the winner was a bit of a mission. At the end after different researches i thougt the best way was to deconstruct the main array containing all players movements and compare it with all the possible combinations.

## Conclusion
I found this project very hard to accomplish but it got me dirty hands on Javascript and Html practice. I had to try things many times before i got them to work and this help a lot understand better the environment
